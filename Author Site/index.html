                    <br/><br/>
                    Clancy Reynolds is about to propose to the woman of his dreams, 
                    but she dumps him for another man before he has the chance.
                    Blinded by rage, he decides to take matters in his own hands.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The plan ends in tragedy, and he’s sent to a psychiatric hospital
                    where his caretakers ask him to be part of a secret experiment.
                    In exchange, he will have his freedom ⎯ if he survives.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Clancy tries to take a hold of his sanity as he descents into madness.
                    Could he really go back like he was before, 
                    or will he succumb to his most twisted desires?</p>

            Miguel Estrada grew up in Caracas, Venezuela with a fascination 
            for the mysterious and the occult as he spent his childhood imagining 
            exciting scenarios that now have translated into stories for him to share. 
            Though he has an inclination for horror, thriller, and suspense, he is no
             stranger to science fiction. His stories are full of colorful characters 
             that always find themselves involved in murder, mystery, and blood, a lot of it.
